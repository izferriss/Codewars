// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( dict in Python) called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
  room1: { name: "room1", description: "room1", completed: false },
  room2: { name: "room2", description: "room2", completed: false },
  room3: { name: "room3", description: "room3", completed: false },
};
